      <p>Pinspiration is a clone of Pinterest with authentication and authorization. Visitors can view an index of pins or an individual pin, and can create a new user account. Logged-in users can view pins, boards, and other user profiles. They can pin and remove photos from their own boards, and can follow and be followed by other users. They also can view a feed of recent activity from those they follow. Admins can delete pins and disable users.</p>
      <p>The project also serves a JSON API for comments on pins, with endpoints for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests for users with API keys. I worked on this project with Erin Pintozzi, Jon Kimble, and Vido Seaver.</p>

      <p>This app is a mock store called Root & Branch, which is a marketplace for socially responsible goods. It is a fully functioning web store written in Rails, complete with user authentication and admin authorization, a functioning cart and checkout, and Bootstrap styling. This was a group project with Erin Pintozzi, Megan Talbot and Ali Schlereth.</p>

      <p>(Work in progress) This project is for a client who wants to create an app to allow new parents to request help from their community. In the current iteration, a user can log in or create an account. They can upload a profile picture up to 1mb in size, and their location is mapped based on the address that they enter. They can create and name a new event (e.g, the birth of a child) and choose their role as either a new parent or an organizer.  They can then choose categories of help that they would like to request. This populates multi-select dropdown menus from which the user can choose specific tasks, which can then be assigned to dates, which populate a calendar. This Rails app incorporates Google maps, uses Paperclip with AWS for image upload, and is styled with Bootstrap 3, HTML, CSS, Sass, and some JQuery. We used Twilio for password reset. I worked with Megan Talbot on this project.</p>
