      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>Pinspiration is a clone of Pinterest with authentication and authorization. Visitors can view an index of pins or an individual pin, and can create a new user account. Logged-in users can view pins, boards, and other user profiles. They can pin and remove photos from their own boards, and can follow and be followed by other users. They also can view a feed of recent activity from those they follow. Admins can delete pins and disable users.</p>
      <p>The project also serves a JSON API for comments on pins, with endpoints for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests for users with API keys. I worked on this project with Erin Pintozzi, Jon Kimble, and Vido Seaver.</p>

      <p>This app is a mock store called Root & Branch, which is a marketplace for socially responsible goods. It is a fully functioning web store written in Rails, complete with user authentication and admin authorization, a functioning cart and checkout, and Bootstrap styling. This was a group project with Erin Pintozzi, Megan Talbot and Ali Schlereth.</p>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>(Work in progress) This project was pitched by a client, who provided us with an overview of the desired user flow for the site. The app is a site that allows people experiencing major life events, such as the birth of a child, to request different kinds of help from their "village." The app allows the user to upload a photo, creates a map for them based on the address they have entered, and creates a slugged profile for them. They can create an event, choose their role in the event, and choose categories of assistance that they need. They then can choose more specific tasks that need to be done, and assign dates to them, so that their "villagers" can choose tasks to help them out.</p>
